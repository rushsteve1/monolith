# Steve's Webserver

<https://rushsteve1.us>

Like all developers I am endlessly making and remaking my personal homepage.
This is just one iteration of that.

To run this standalone compile it using the [`main` submodule](./main/).

# URL Paths

- `/` The index landing page
- `/blog/<id>` My various ramblings, now in HTML
- `/cgi-bin/<script>` Serverless is just CGI but more complicated
